# Coupled Oscillators: Linear and Nonlinear Dynamics

Numerical simulation of coupled oscillators comparing linear and nonlinear interactions using scientific computing tools.

## 📌 Description
This project studies the dynamics of two coupled oscillators using numerical integration.
Both a linear coupling model and a nonlinear (cubic) interaction are analyzed and compared to highlight differences in system behavior.

The equations of motion are solved using the Runge–Kutta 4th order (RK4) method.
